# SCADA-GAN-Synthetic-Generation

Synthetic generation of SCADA datasets with General Adversarial networks.
Started with a simple GAN network and evolved to WGAN and CGANs with different results.

** Future Works ** : Work with deeper timebased relationships across generaton-discriminator loss function.
