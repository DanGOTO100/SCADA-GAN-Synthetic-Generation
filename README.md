# SCADA-GAN-Synthetic-Generation

Synthetic generation of SCADA datasets with General Adversarial networks.
Started with a simple GAN network and evolved to WGAN and CGANs with different results.

Used Keras and 2 Features: Generator Frequency and Generator Volt Phase for simpler approach

Obervations: With 2 features the synthetic dataset obtained is very similar to the real one. Oh Yeah!!

But...When using larger number of features Gradient Vanishement is observed (as noted in Ian GoodFellow's paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661 ). Further tested with Wassertein GAN (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875) implementation to solve this situation and generating more features and CGANs for better results.
